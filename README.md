# Module 2 - Mini-Project - To-Do List Application
Author: Elizabeth Yates

The To-Do List Application has five major features, as shown on the main menu. 

## Main Menu

Menu:

1 - Add a task  
2 - View tasks  
3 - Mark a task as complete  
4 - Delete a task  
5 - Quit  
  
- At the menu, the user will be prompted to choose an option by selecting a number. 
- If they select a number out of the range (1-5) or input a word, they will be reminded that that's not a valid input and prompted again. 
- After each action, the user will be given a choice to return to the main menu or choose their next move (1-5)

## Add a Task
- This option will allow the user to input a unique task to add to the to-do list. 
- The task will be added to the top of the list and the user will be alerted that it's been added to the list and given the option of returning to the main menu or choosing their next action (1-5)
- If the task is already on the to-do list, the user will be alerted and brought back to the main menu. 

## View Tasks
- This option will display the to-do list with the incomplete tasks firsts (starting with the latest addition) and then the completed tasks. 
- Incomplete tasks will be shown with an empty checkbox '[ ]', and the completed tasks will have a checked checkbox '[X]'.
- The user will then be  given the option of returning to the main menu or choosing their next action (1-5)

For example: 

To-Do List:

[X] Have breakfast
