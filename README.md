# Module 2 - Mini-Project - To-Do List Application
Author: Elizabeth Yates

The To-Do List Application has five major features, as shown on the main menu. 

## Main Menu

Menu:

1 - Add a task ^p
2 - View tasks ^p
3 - Mark a task as complete \n
4 - Delete a task \n
5 - Quit \n

- At the menu, the user will be prompted to choose an option by selecting a number. 
- If they select a number out of the range (1-5) or input a word, they will be reminded that that's not a valid input and prompted again. 
- Every option should bring the user back to the main menu

## Add a Task
- This option will allow the user to input a unique task to add to the to-do list. 
- The task will be added to the top of the list and the user will be alerted that it's been added to the list and brought back to the main menu. 
- If the task is already on the to-do list, the user will be alerted and brought back to the main menu. 

## View Tasks
- This option will display the to-do list with the incomplete tasks firsts (starting with the latest addition) and then the completed tasks. 
- Incomplete tasks will be shown with an empty checkbox '[ ]', and the completed tasks will have a checked checkbox '[X]'.
- The user will then be brought back to the main menu

For example: 

To-Do List:

[ ] Take the kids to school
[ ] Do the laundry
[X] Walk the dog
[X] Have breakfast

## Mark a Task as Complete
- This option will prompt the user to provide a task and change its status from 'Incomplete' to 'Complete'.
- Once this is done, it will inform the user and bring them back to the main menu.
- If the user provides a task that's not in the list, it will inform the user and bring them back to the main menu.

## Delete a Task
- This option will remove the task provided by the user from the list. 
- Once this is done, it will inform the user and bring them back to the main menu. 
- If the user provides a task that's not in the list, it will inform the user and bring them back to the main menu.

## Quit
- This option will thank the user and exit the program.
